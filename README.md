## About the Project

Flashback Photobooth is a web-based application that brings the charm of old-school photo booths to your browser. Users can step in front of their webcam, choose from various vintage-inspired templates (like classic strips or Polaroids), capture a series of photos, apply nostalgic filters, and then download their unique digital memento. The project focuses on delivering a delightful user experience with a strong vintage aesthetic, complete with subtle animations, sound effects, and classic design elements.

## Features

* **Vintage Aesthetic:** Designed with a warm, amber-toned color palette, custom fonts (serif and typewriter-style), and subtle textured backgrounds to evoke a retro feel.
* **Camera Integration:** Seamlessly access and display live camera feed from the user's device.
* **Template Selection:** Choose from multiple photo layouts (e.g., photo strips, grid, Polaroid) for your final output.
* **Guided Photo Capture:** An interactive countdown and visual cues guide the user through the photo-taking process.
* **Developing Effect:** A simulated "developing" animation adds to the vintage charm after photos are captured.
* **Filter Application:** Apply a range of vintage-inspired filters (sepia, black & white, warm, cool, etc.) to the composite image.
* **Composite Image Generation:** Photos are automatically compiled into a single, beautifully arranged template.
* **Download Functionality:** Easily download the final filtered photo strip/image.
* **Sound Effects:** Immersive audio cues for shutter clicks, film advance, and other interactions.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for a smooth experience across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Customization

* **Templates:** Modify `src/utils/templates.ts` to add new photo layouts, adjust dimensions, or change slot positions.
* **Filters:** Expand `src/utils/canvasUtils.ts` in the `applyCanvasFilter` function to create new image filters. For more complex filters (like light leaks or film burns), you might need to layer additional drawing operations.
* **Styling:** Adjust `tailwind.config.js` or `src/index.css` to change the vintage color palette, fonts, or other visual aspects. Custom utility classes can be added in `index.css`.
* **Sounds:** Update `src/utils/audioUtils.ts` to add or modify sound effects.
* **Stickers:** Modify `src/components/VintageStickers.tsx` to add, remove, or change the decorative icons.
